# White Hat Gaming Looby test
# running the project in tour machine 
- git clone https://github.com/baloyijs/looby.git
- rum npm install
-ng serve 
- in your browser run http://localhost:4200/
# Notes about the test
-  Angular 11.
- I have used Material icons.
- I have used Angular Flex Layout, which I find very convinient to work with for flex and responsiveness, alternative was to use bootstrap or tailwing for accuracy
- I was thinking about using SCSS imports and variables, but since CSS is quite good at it already with Custom Properties, that's been the approach taken.
_ I like the use of barrel strategy and custom alias for absolute paths, but it needs to be used carefully.
- I have added configuration for global imports of SCSS.
